# Challenge description

Have you ever heard the term "The sum of two squares"?

It's like the following :
```
4 = 0^2 + 2^2
8 = 2^2 + 2^2
16 = 0^2 + 4^2
----------------------------
5002 = 39^2 + 59^2 => 49^2 + 51^2 => 51^2 + 49^2 => 59^2 + 39^2
And so on. In the example of 16, if we add the square of 0 & 4 we get 16. So here we are getting two values 0 & 4. So that's the answer.

So write a program & find out the two values of 25000. Conditions are the following :

* Remove the duplicates
* Pick the third one
```
